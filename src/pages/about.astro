      <p class="text-lg">
        I'm <strong>Jan Medina</strong>, an IT Professional based in <strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>.
        By day, I manage enterprise device fleets and automate IT workflows. By night (and weekends),
        I build iOS apps and web apps — always looking to level up with every project.
      </p>
      <p>
        My full-time work revolves around keeping hundreds of devices secure, compliant, and running smoothly
        using tools like JAMF Pro and Microsoft Intune. I write PowerShell scripts, deploy MDM policies, and
        manage the entire lifecycle of enterprise devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the development side, I work primarily with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>
        for web, and <strong>Swift</strong> for iOS. I'm a practical builder — I use AI tools as a multiplier
        to ship ideas faster, while keeping the craft and architecture solid underneath.

      <div class="space-y-4 text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>Ship fast. Learn faster.</strong> Every project is a hands-on lesson to get sharper at
          coding, architecture, and shipping real stuff. I treat side projects as my personal training ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplicity first.</strong> I prefer elegant, minimal solutions over clever complexity.
          Clean code that another human (including future me) can read and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AI-assisted, not AI-dependent.</strong> I use AI tools heavily to accelerate development,
          but the architecture decisions, the debugging, and the craft — that's all human.
